## Service Runtime Configuration

Using gems like:

- vmware's official --> [cf-runtime](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap-ruby) or
- Monica's --> [cloudfoundry-env](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/cloudfoundry-env)

You can read the runtime environment and connect to each service

### Auto Reconfiguration
- If you only have one service you can let Cloud Foundry auto configure your connection.
- No need to change any code
- **It just works**

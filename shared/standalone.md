## Standalone applications 

### `Coming Soon` to cloudfoundry.com

### - Normal system processes rather than deployed through an application or web server. 

### - Great for background or asynchronous jobs that work on processing items off a queue, for example. 

### - The standalone Ruby applications will support such worker libraries as `resque` or `delayed_jobs` 

### - Ability to run rake tasks directly from the console

- Requires 0.3.16.beta.5 or higher.

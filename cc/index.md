## Ruby Support

!SLIDE

## VMC is a gem

### VMC can be used by *any* Ruby Application

### VMC commands work against *any* Cloud Foundry instance

    Gemfile

    source "http://rubygems.org"

    gem "sinatra"
    gem "shotgun"
    gem "json", "~> 1.4.6", :require => "json/pure"
    gem "haml"
    gem "vmc", "~> 0.3.16.beta.5"

`gem "vmc"`

!SLIDE

## Using VMC from Sinatra

At the top of your app.rb include `require "vmc/client"`

You can then use `VMC::Client`

## Example

    get "/apps" do
        @vmcclient = VMC::Client.new(@target, @token)
        @apps = @vmcclient.apps
        haml :apps
    end
